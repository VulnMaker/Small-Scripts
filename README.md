# Small-Scripts
This repo mainly to save the small scripts I wrote to automate small tasks that I do not to repeat every time

## require.py
because there are many tools that need many libraries to run and in every time we create new VM or OS that files need to install the same requirement.txt file, I wrote this script to list & install all this libraries once you run it.
you can run it with "sudo python3 require.py"
